    "## Tips for Kaggale Competition \n",
    "1. We have 3 data files generally: Train | Test | sample_submission_file\n",
    "2. Check the sample_submission file to see the\n",
    "    - `format of output`. \n",
    "    - The variable to predict \n",
    "    - Mostly there is `ID` column in this file representing the `ID` of row in test file\n",
    "3. Check the type of Problem: Classification/Regression/other \n",
    "    - Make the histogram of target variable from train data\n",
    "    - `train['target'].hist()` \n",
    "    - Check if it is **Continous or Discrete**\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. We can directly give the Dataframe and Series to `model.fit(X=df[[\"feat-1\", \"feat-2\"]], y=df['target'])`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Good Practice \n",
    "    - We have test_df which has all features except the target variable to predict\n",
    "        - You can put the predictions in this same dataframe \n",
    "        - `test_df['target'] = model.predict(test_df[['feat-1', 'feat-2']])`\n",
    "        - Then you can use this dataframe to save the submission file \n",
    "        - `test_df[['id', 'target']].to_csv(\"file_name.csv\", index=false)`\n",
    "        \n",
    "6. Public and Private Leaderboard \n",
    "    - Test data is divided by kaggle into Public test data and Private test data(hidden from us)\n",
    "    - During the competition, results are calculated only on the Public test. After the competition is over results are calculated on the Private test set. \n",
    "        - This can lead to `Overfitting` \n",
    "    - During the competition we see performance on Public test data, so we try to improve it and there is a chance that our model performs good on Public test data but not generalizes for Private test data, thus leading to **Overfitting**. \n",
    "        - We need a good validation stratergy to insure there is no overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which Model to choose \n",
    "    - Out of different hyper parameters choose the model which gives highest validation accuracy"

    "\n",
    "## Workflow\n",
    "1. Understand the Problem and Result Metric \n",
    "    - Data type\n",
    "        - Tabular form, time series, images, text or mix of them\n",
    "    - Problem type \n",
    "        - Classification, regression, ranking , other \n",
    "    - Evaluation Metric \n",
    "        - ROC-AUC, F1-score, MAE, MSE\n",
    "        - Generally metrics are implemented in sklearn but if not then implement them manually\n",
    "2. EDA (to understand the data we are working with)\n",
    "    1. To visualize the data and patterns in the data \n",
    "    2. Recommended things to do in EDA\n",
    "        - Size of data \n",
    "            - Know the size and shape of data, it give us idea about what kind of resources we have to use (cpu, gpu, ram) and what kind of algorithms can be employed depending on the resources available\n",
    "        - Properties of Target Variable \n",
    "            - Continous or Discrete i.e Classification or Regression Problem \n",
    "            - **Check Class Imbalance in classification and Skewed Distribution in Regression**\n",
    "        - Properties of Features \n",
    "            - Find the dependencies or relation between features and target variable\n",
    "            - Find relationship between different features \n",
    "        - Generate idea for feature engineering \n",
    "            - While doing EDA, think alongside what feature engineering can be done.\n",
    "3. Local validation \n",
    "    - Consider, we train our model on training data and evaluate on Public data set, then we try to improve model performance by changing hyperparameters. Again we train on training data and evaluate on Public data set. By this way even if we obtain a model with good performance on Public data set, then it is not sure that model will behave similarly on unseen data. By this method, model may overfit the Public data set. \n",
    "    - We want to approximate the model's performance on the Private data set. But Private data set is hidden how to achieve this approximation \n",
    "    - `Hold out set`\n",
    "        - Divide the training data into train set and hold out set, and evaluate model on hold out set, but same problem here, model can overfit the hold out set.\n",
    "    - `kFold Cross Validation`\n",
    "        - Divide the training data into k-folds(k-chunks). \n",
    "        - Keep each fold as test set and train on the other folds. \n",
    "        - We will get k scores for models, say you train 2 models, now to find which is better, try to form a single metric from these k scores and compare that to choose the better model.\n",
    "            - E.g Mean of k scores is one such metric \n",
    "            - Try to improve this mean score.\n",
    "        - This is the good approximation to the Private Data set. There is no chance of overfitting. \n",
    "    - `Stratified kFold Cross Validation`\n",
    "        - Similar to kFold only difference is Target variable distribution in total train data and each fold is same. \n",
    "        - See the PDF Documentation\n",
    "    - `Time kFold Cross Validation`\n",
    "        - For time series data \n",
    "        - We provide splits in such a manner that we train on past data and always predict the future data.\n",
    "        - Need to sort data before applying it.\n",
    "    - For code see the PDF\n",
    "    - How to choose the evaluation score \n",
    "        - If we have k-folds then we will get k scores for each fold. \n",
    "        - Now we train 2 different models(with different hyperparameters). Now to decide which model is better we need single metric. What could be the single metric/score ?\n",
    "            - Mean over all k-fold scores\n",
    "                - Not a good choice, it don't take into account score deviation from one fold to another\n",
    "                - We can have very good performance on one single fold and very poor performance on rest k-1 folds. In such case Mean is not very reliable score. (due to one good score, mean of this model improves however model is not that good on general data.)\n",
    "            - Better Metric for validation score \n",
    "                - Score = One std deviation away from mean (Considering worst case scenario)\n",
    "                - We subtract or add stddev based on whether we are trying to maximize or minimze the score.\n",
    "                - If score is MSE , we try to minimize it, in order to consider worst case scenario\n",
    "                    - `overall_score = mean_score + stdev`\n",
    "                - If score is ROC_AUC, we try to maximize it\n",
    "                    - `Overall score = mean_score - stdev`\n",
    "                - SEE PDF \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Modeling \n",
    "    1. Modeling loop : (preprocess-data --> create new features --> improve models --> apply new tricks)\n",
    "        - Majority of actions that we take will not work, we have to look for subsample of actions which improve both local validation score and Pulbic Leaderboard score\n",
    "        - If we observe an improvement in local validation we keep the change otherwise discard it. \n",
    "        - **Important:** tweak only one thing at a time, if we change multiple things, then we can't detect what works and what doesn't.\n",
    "    2. Feature Engineering \n",
    "        - It is a process of creating new features \n",
    "        - It helps our model get additional information and consequently to better predict the target variable.\n",
    "        - How one gets idea about how to create new features ?\n",
    "            - Prior experience of working in similar data \n",
    "            - EDA (analyzing data give us insights about data and what new features we can create)\n",
    "            - Domain Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Leakage \n",
    "1. It causes the model to seem accurate until we start making predictions in real-world environment.\n",
    "    - It makes poor predictions in real world and become useless \n",
    "2. Different types of Data Leakage \n",
    "    - Leak in features\n",
    "        - We are using data that will not be available in the real settings.\n",
    "        - e.g We are training model to predict sales in US dollars, then use that model to predict sales in UK pounds. Model will behave poorly.\n",
    "    - Leak in validation stratergy\n",
    "        - When validation stratergy doesn't replicate the real world situation\n",
    "        - e.g Say we have time series data, using simple k-fold stratergy here, so say we did 5 splits, in one of the combination we will train on last 4 folds and test on 1st fold, this is more like training model on future data and predicting past data from it. In real world situation this will never happen. \n",
    "        - Need to be more careful with time series data (use Time k-fold Validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### EDA \n",
    "1. Check size and shape of train and test data \n",
    "2. Check the columns in dataframe \n",
    "3. Use dataframe.describe() to see basic stats about data \n",
    "4. Use dataframe.info() to see missing values and datatype of each column\n",
    "4. See distribution of Target Variable\n",
    "5. Plot some curves to see the relation between features and target variable and other insights\n",

    "    - Coordinates (Geo spatial data)\n",
    "    - text\n",
    "    - images\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Generally we create new features for train and test data simultaneously, in some cases we create them independently.\n",
    "    - Concat train and test : `data = pd.concat([train, test])`\n",
    "    - Create new features on `data`\n",
    "    - Separate out train & test: `train = data[data.id.isin(train.id)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Creating new Features \n",
    "    - `Arithmetic features`\n",
    "        - Taking two or more features and applying mathematical operations to create new feature \n",
    "        - e.g: given length and width of houses, we can create new feature `area = length*width`\n",
    "        - e.g: given no_of_bedrooms & price of house, we can create new feature `price-per-bedroom`\n",
    "    - `New feature from Datetime features` \n",
    "        - Extracting year, day, month, week, week-of-month, hour-of-day, etc many such features from Datetime features\n",
    "        - `df['date-obj'] = pd.to_datetime(df['datetime'])`\n",
    "            - create date time object and use its `.dt` attribute\n",
    "        - `df['year'] = df['date-obj'].dt.year` \n",
    "        - `df['hour-of-day'] = df['date-obj'].dt.hour`\n",
    "    - `Categorical Features` \n",
    "        - Most of models don't handle strings and categorical features automatically(categorical features are generally in string form). We need to convert them to numbers \n",
    "        - 2 common approaches to convert Categorical features to numbers \n",
    "            - **Label Encoder** Map categories to numbers \n",
    "                - e.g: {dog, cat, fish, monkey} --> {0, 1, 2, 3}\n",
    "                - There is Ranking dependency here, Rank/label of monkey=3 which is lot higher than Rank/label of dog.\n",
    "                - Such Ranking dependency cause problem for linear models, for tree based models it doesn't cause any problem \n",
    "            - **One HoT EncoDing** Create column for each category and assign value 0/1 \n",
    "                - If No. of categories is high(in 1000s) then there will be many features.\n",
    "                - We can create 1 less column than total categories, assumption is if for (n-1) categories feature value = 0 then this automatically means category of this example is nth one. \n",
    "        - Binary Features\n",
    "            - Values: Yes/No, On/Off \n",
    "            - Use Label Encoder because labels will be 0 or 1 which will be same as One Hot encoding so no need of putting an extra column.\n",
    "        - **Note: Don't forget to remove the original columns afterwards**\n",
    "    - `Target Encoding`\n",
    "        - Label Encoder produces ranking dependency and One hot Encoder creates many features, so we need better option.\n",
    "        - Target Encoding only generates a single column \n",
    "        - It introduces the correlation between the category and the target variable\n",
    "        - Target Encoding is of different types \n",
    "            - Mean Target Encoding \n",
    "                - How to Apply is understood but Theory and intution behind it is not clear\n",

    "### Modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Baseline models and validation stratergy\n",
    "1. Creating/Trying out the models and validation stratergy.\n",
    "    - Having a good validation stratergy is important, a good stratergy will give approximation of how our model is going to perform on the Private Dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Baseline Model\n",
    "    - First step should be create 1 or more baseline models\n",
    "    - This model will act as lower limit, whatever thing you try out, the model performance can't go lower than the baseline model, if it is lower than baseline model, there is something wrong.\n",
    "        - Simplest Baseline Models can be `take avearage over train data and assign this average value to all the observations in the test data` \n",
    "        - Another Baseline: `Train a GradientBoostingRegressor on train data with numerical features only and make predictions`\n",
    "    - It can be used to review the local validation stratergy \n",
    "        - If a local validation stratergy is good for baseline model, we can use that for our other experiments as well\n",
    "        - Simplest local validation stratergy: Split train data in (70% train 30% hold out)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Review the Validation Stratergy \n",
    "    - `Correlation of Local Validation with Public LeaderBoard` \n",
    "    - Say we train 3 models (A,B,C) and get scores on the validation data and Public leaderboard data, then there should be correlation between these 2 scores over the different models otherwise there is something wrong with the models or validation stratergy\n",
    "    - `Idea is validation stratergy should make our model generalized, if it is not even generalized over Public data then it will fail over Private data as well`\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Hyper-Parameter Tunning \n",
    "1. Good value of Hyper-Parameter(model parameters) can improve the model performance\n",
    "2. When to try Hyper Parameter tunning \n",
    "    1. In classical approaches first try to improve the model performance by introducing `new features`.\n",
    "    2. When you exhausted with new features and not able to make new features, then Go for Hyper-Parameter Tunning. \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. In classical ML: Feature Engineering + Hyper Parameter Optimization \n",
    "4. In Deep learning:  NO feature engineering but Hyper Parameter Optimization is done \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Different Stratergies \n",
    "    1. Grid Search\n",
    "        - Try out each value of grid. Need to predefine the elements of search space.\n",
    "        - First specify values far apart in grid. E.g: (3,9, 16, 25). When you get the scores for these values and get an idea of range in which the optimal value of hyper-parameter will lie, then choose a grid with values where we can get optimal values. \n",
    "            - For e.g: we did grid search on values (3, 9, 16, 25) then we see the results we get idea that optimum value will be btw 9 and 16 then again repeat the process with new grid : (9, 12, 14, 16).\n",
    "    2. Random Search\n",
    "        - Try out random values from search space.\n",
    "        - Need to specify the search space range only not each value  \n",
    "    3. Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "        - Need to specify search space range\n",
    "        - It uses past evaluation results to choose the next hyper-parameters value to evaluate\n",
    "        \n",
    "**Note: The drawback of tuning each hyperparameter independently is a potential dependency between different hyperparameters(Different hyper-params can depend on each other). The better approach is to try all the possible hyperparameter combinations.** \n",
